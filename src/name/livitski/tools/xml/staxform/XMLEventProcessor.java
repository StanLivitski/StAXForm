/**
 * A simple contract for user-defined transformations of
 * {@link XMLEvent XML events}. XML input is pushed into
 * the processor via the {@link #add(XMLEvent)} method.
 * Once the processor
 * has output ready, it returns <code>true</code> from
 * {@link #hasNext()} and furnishes its results via
 * {@link #next()}. The callers may post zero, one, or more
 * {@link XMLEvent XML events} to the processor before
 * polling it for output. Processors do not have to yield
 * any output until they receive the required input. They
 * MUST, however, retain all the output they create in its
 * original sequence until polled or {@link #reset() reset},
 * regardless of any extra input they may receive before
 * being polled. Processors
 * MAY throw an {@link XMLStreamException} from the
 * {@link #add(XMLEvent)} method if they run out of resources
 * needed to store the input.
 * <br/>Implementors are NOT expected to support the
 * {@link #remove()} method which currently has no meaning
 * when applied to this interface.
 * <br />Implementors may extend, or delegate to, an instance
 * of {@link IdentityEventProcessor} to store the events
 * they produce until polled.
